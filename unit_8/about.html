  <b>About Us:</b> <br>
	Globetrotter Travel was designed with a unique premise - to serve "hardcore travelers" - those travelers who have seen a good amount of the world and thus have a different outlook on travel.  You don't need to have your hand held like a "newbie" traveler does.  You emjoy having unique, interesting experiences in the places you visit -- you're not just another tourist being led around on a tour bus full of 50 people.  Importantly, you also want to travel in the company of others who are well-traveled, and to connect with others who have great travel stories and adventures to share. If this sounds intiguing to you, Globetrotter Travel is the right travel partner for you!
